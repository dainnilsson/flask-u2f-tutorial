    ~ What is MiniTwit U2F Tutorial?

      A step-by-step tutorial on adding U2F support to an existing application.
      Starting from the MiniTwit example from the Flask microframework, this
      tutorial shows the steps needed to secur access to user accounts using
      U2F.

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. Follow along the steps in the tutorial/X tags and compare the code
         changes between the tags. If you want to, you can run the code at each
         step to see the changes in action.

      2. To run the project, first install the required dependencies by running:

         $ pip install -r requirements.txt

         Then initialize the database:
         
         $ python minitwit.py --init-db

         Now run the server:

         $ python minitwit.py

      Update: For a step-by-step deployment guide for Windows, see the
      Flask U2F Tutorial - Deployment Guide.pdf file included in this repository.


    ~ Is it tested?

      You betcha.  Run the `minitwit_tests.py` file to
      see the tests pass.
